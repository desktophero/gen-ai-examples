 # **Frobnitz Fizzbuzz Access Control System (FFACS)**

## **Overview**

The Frobnitz Fizzbuzz Access Control System (FFACS) is a state-of-the-art security solution designed to regulate and manage access to the Quibblenook Corporation's top-secret data. FFACS ensures only authorized Gobblewumps can reach the Snorkleberries, maintaining the company's confidentiality and safety.

## **Key Concepts**

### **Frobnitz Tokens (FT)**

Every user in our system is assigned a unique Frobnitz Token (FT), which serves as their digital identity. These FTs are generated using our proprietary Flibberwink algorithm and are non-transferable.

### **Fizzy Levels**

Access to various data sections in our system is tiered based on Fizzy Levels. There are five Fizzy Levels, each with increasing access privileges: Snurple (Level 1), Glorp (Level 2), Slurge (Level 3), Quibblo (Level 4), and Klink (Level 5).

## **Access Control**

### **Role-Based Access**

FFACS implements role-based access, assigning permissions based on a user's role within the organization. The roles are as follows:

1. **Frobnizor**: Has full control over all data and FFACS settings.
2. **Fizzbuzz Manager**: Manages user accounts, groups, and Fizzy Levels.
3. **Frobojum**: Accesses data relevant to their job function.
4. **Snurple Sniffer**: Limited access to specific data areas for auditing purposes.

### **Permission Matrix**

Each user's Frobnitz Token has an associated permission matrix, which defines the Fizzy Levels they can access and the actions they can perform within those levels. This ensures granular control over data access.

## **Access Requests and Approval**

Users seeking to access higher Fizzy Levels must request approval from their supervisor or designated approver. The request includes justification for the need of increased access and potential impact on the organization. Once approved, the user's permission matrix is updated accordingly.

## **Two-Factor Authentication**

To enhance security, all users are required to use two-factor authentication when logging into the system. This involves entering their Frobnitz Token and a unique, time-based code from their Sprocket Device.

## **Auditing and Reporting**

FFACS includes robust auditing and reporting capabilities. All user actions within the system are recorded, including successful logins, permission changes, and data access attempts. Regular reports are generated to help maintain compliance with security policies and regulations.

## **Conclusion**

The Frobnitz Fizzbuzz Access Control System ensures that our Quibblenook Corporation data remains secure while enabling our team members to perform their duties effectively. With its robust role-based access, granular control over permissions, and strong authentication measures, FFACS is the cornerstone of our security strategy.
