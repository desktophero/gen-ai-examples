 Title: **Foobaz Secure Transmission Protocol (FoSTP) - Encryption Guide**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Foobaz Secure Transmission Protocol (FoSTP) Encryption Guide! This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of encryption techniques utilized within our system, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

## Encryption Overview

The heart of FoSTP lies in its robust encryption mechanisms. We employ the **Snoozlefish** algorithm, a symmetric key-based cryptographic method that ensures secure communication between our users. The Snoozlefish algorithm is designed to withstand various attacks and provides high levels of security.

## Encryption Process

### Key Generation (Kyngen)

The Kyngen process generates unique, random encryption keys for each user upon account creation. These keys are crucial in securing data transmitted through the FoSTP network. The generated keys are encrypted using a master key (MasterKey) to ensure their security during storage and transmission.

### Data Encryption (DatEncrypt)

Before sending any sensitive information, the data is first converted into a format suitable for encryption using the **Flobberwock** method. Once transformed, it is encrypted using the user's generated key (UserKey). The resulting ciphertext is then encapsulated within a packet for secure transmission across the FoSTP network.

### Data Decryption (DatDecrypt)

Upon receiving an encrypted packet, the recipient uses their UserKey to decrypt the ciphertext and convert it back into its original format using the Flobberwock method. This ensures that only the intended recipient can access the data, preserving its confidentiality.

## Key Exchange (KeyXchg)

To facilitate secure communication between two parties without compromising their privacy, FoSTP employs a key exchange mechanism known as **BlubberBark**. During a BlubberBark session, each user shares a piece of their UserKey with the other party. Using this shared information and a predefined algorithm (AlgoZook), both parties can derive a shared secret key (SharedKey) that will be used for encrypting subsequent communication.

## Security Considerations

It is essential to maintain the confidentiality of your UserKey. Keep it secure, and avoid sharing it with unauthorized individuals. If you suspect that your UserKey has been compromised, please change it immediately using our Kyngen service.

## Conclusion

The Foobaz Secure Transmission Protocol (FoSTP) employs a variety of encryption techniques to ensure the security and privacy of our users' data. By understanding these mechanisms, you can make informed decisions about how best to protect your sensitive information within the FoSTP network.
