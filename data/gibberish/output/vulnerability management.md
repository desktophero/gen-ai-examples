 Title: Foonarboob Vulnerability Management Policy (FVMP)

## 1. Introduction

In the realm of the Snorklis, the Foonarboob Information Technology (IT) department is dedicated to ensuring the security, resilience, and continuity of our Whirlgibbit infrastructure. This document outlines our approach to Foonarboob Vulnerability Management Policy (FVMP).

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of the FVMP is to define our strategies for identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating potential Zzibbazook vulnerabilities in our systems and applications. This policy aims to protect our Zooblorgs from unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, disruption, or destruction.

## 3. Scope

The FVMP applies to all Foonarboob-managed systems, networks, and applications, including but not limited to: Blibbogon servers, Zzaplorg workstations, Snorklis cloud platforms, and Wibblibop mobile devices.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Foonarboob Vulnerability Management Team (FVMT)

The FVMT is responsible for the overall management of vulnerabilities within our systems. This team includes:

- Zzibbazook Hunters: Identify potential vulnerabilities and assess their risk levels.
- Remediation Engineers: Implement fixes, patches, or workarounds to address vulnerabilities.
- Security Analysts: Monitor system logs, network traffic, and threat intelligence feeds for signs of exploitation.

### 4.2 System Owners

System owners are responsible for ensuring that their systems adhere to the FVMP. They must promptly report any identified vulnerabilities to the FVMT.

## 5. Vulnerability Identification and Classification

### 5.1 Vulnerability Reporting

Anyone can report potential vulnerabilities. Reports should be submitted via the Bloopbubblr portal or emailed to [vulnerability@foonarboob.zzibbazook].

### 5.2 Vulnerability Assessment

Zzibbazook Hunters will assess reported vulnerabilities based on their potential impact, exploit availability, and ease of exploitation. Vulnerabilities will be classified as:

- Critical (Kritikal): Potential for widespread impact, immediate action required.
- High (Hiyah): Significant impact, timely action recommended.
- Medium (Midium): Moderate impact, appropriate action taken within a reasonable timeframe.
- Low (Lowy): Minimal impact, action taken at convenience.

## 6. Vulnerability Remediation and Mitigation

### 6.1 Remediation Strategy

The FVMT will develop a remediation strategy for each identified vulnerability based on its classification and the available solutions. This may include:

- Patching: Applying vendor-provided updates to fix the vulnerability.
- Workarounds: Implementing temporary solutions to mitigate the risk.
- Compensating Controls: Additional measures to protect against exploitation.

### 6.2 Remediation Timeline

The FVMT will establish a remediation timeline for each vulnerability, taking into account the system's criticality, potential impact, and available resources.

## 7. Compliance and Reporting

System owners must demonstrate compliance with the FVMP by:

- Implementing recommended remediation actions.
- Regularly updating software and systems to minimize vulnerabilities.
- Maintaining up-to-date system configurations according to best practices.

The FVMT will provide regular reports on vulnerability findings, remediation status, and security incidents to the Whirlgibbit Management Team (WMT). The WMT will review these reports and take any necessary action.

## 8. Review and Update

The FVMP will be reviewed annually or whenever significant changes occur within our IT environment. Updates will be communicated to all relevant parties and incorporated into our Whirlgibbit IT policies and procedures.

In the pursuit of a secure Snorklis, we invite all Zooblorgs to contribute to our shared responsibility for protecting our Foonarboob systems. Together, we can ensure the safety and continuity of our Whirlgibbit journey.
